Silly, silly, little script... Munpop fetches population data from _Statistics Sweden_ (SCB). Select a municipality and (optionally) a year between 1968 and 2013 and you have got yourself some population figures, my friend. 

####Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Add munpop.py to your PATH
3. (Optional) Create an alias `alias munpop="munpop.py"` in .bashrc

####Usage
    munpop <municipality> [year]
